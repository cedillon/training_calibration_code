--Core Method and Species Inventory Calibration Code--
Calibration ensures the defensibility and integrity of data by providing evidence that the data are consistent and trustworthy. This code serves to evaluate the calibration exercise success of Vegetation Height, Line-Point Intercept, Canopy-Gap Intercept, & Species Inventory.
Outputs include 3 csv files for group/crew absolute differences per indicator, indicator pass fail status,
calibration exercise pass fail status. 3 figures per method showing class method success, class indicator success per method,
and spread of absolute differnce per indicator per method. More information on calibration can be found in the Monitoring Manual for Grassland, Shrubland, and Savanna Ecosystems: Volume 1 2nd Edition (Herrick et. al., 2017).
