The script requires the following inputs:
1)A csv file with crew and member Core Method annd Species Richness summary information
2)A file location for the csv file
3)An output location for csv and 
 In this format ![C:\training_2020\crew_calibration_results_presentation\code\input_screenshot.png]
 
The script outputs include 3 csv files:
- qualitiative_report, descriptions
